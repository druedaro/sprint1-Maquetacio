# ðŸŽ¨ Sprint 1 - Design to Development - ITACADEMY
ðŸš§ WARNING: This project is still in progress and not yet complete.
Some features, styles, or sections may be missing or unfinished.

This project is a design replication exercise to practice styling with different approaches.

The same design is implemented three times using:

Vanilla CSS
SASS
Tailwind CSS
## ðŸ§© Project Structure
The project is organized into separate Git branches, each containing a different version of the same layout:

Vanilla-CSS: the base implementation using plain CSS
SASS-Refactor: the same layout refactored with SASS
Tailwind-Refactor-v2: the final version using Tailwind CSS
Each branch is independent, so you can switch between them and see how the same layout is built using different technologies.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To explore each version of the project, youâ€™ll need to clone and checkout each branch individually.

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/druedaro/sprint1-Maquetacio.git
